                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    From an early age, I have been fascinated by the limitless possibilities of technology and the creative potential it holds. Whether it's solving complex problems, exploring new fields, or tackling challenges, my curiosity and passion for learning have always driven me to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I earned my BSc in Computer Science & Engineering from Patuakhali Science & Technology University in Patuakhali, Bangladesh. It was during this time that I developed a deep interest in research and competitive programming, passions that continue to shape my career and academic pursuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My teaching career began at the University of Scholars, where I worked as a Lecturer from November 2023 until June 2023. In July 2024, I joined Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT) as a Lecturer in Computer Science & Engineering, where I strive to inspire the next generation of engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academia, I have participated in various activities such as the Math Olympiad, Science Fairs, and others, all of which have helped hone my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. I have also been actively involved in volunteering, which has significantly enhanced my leadership, communication, and teamwork abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking to the future, I am excited about the opportunities ahead, as I continue to challenge myself, contribute to advancements in technology and research, and make a positive impact on the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy reading thriller books and watching thriller movies. I also enjoy gardening and connecting with people, making new friends along the way.
                </p>
